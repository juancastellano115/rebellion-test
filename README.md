Hola Juan Castellano! This is the test. Good luck!

## Description

Create an application using [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/)

You are going to do calls to an external API [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)

This application is going to run into a cluster so it could be good "dockerize" it.

### Find a Pokemon by name

Sample URL POST: SOME_URL/pokemon/findByName

{
        name: "PIKa chu"
}


Result sample:


```
{
   count: 2,
   results: [
         {
                base_experience: 112,
                name: 'pikachu',
                height: 4,
                weight: 60
         },
         ...
   ]

}

```

###

Sample URL GET: SOME_URL/pokemon/csv/:color

Returns a CSV file with a list of All Pokemons of a color order by base_experience

```
name;base_experience;height;weight
pikachu;112;4;60
...
```
